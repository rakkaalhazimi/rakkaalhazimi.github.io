You should've already know that linear regression is a linear model that is used to predicts scalar target/response based on its relationship with explanatory variable using the linear function. We can see it as a line that goes through the
small or big amount of data. The line is designed by the matematical equation which we called a function, a linear one. If you don't have a grasp about what linearity is, it's just a thing that have a constant change over time, like our age, we sure will get 1 year older for every year we passed. 

Aside from linearity, what does the "regression" means in linear regression?, well it's a reduction from its original state. Then, which reduction do we see in there? it's just a line that overlap the data, how can they see it as a reduction?. If you look closely, you'll notice that those line that we're talking about is try to **simply explain** the relationship between a response and explanatory variables. The explanation here is simplified by the form of a line that goes through the data. That is the reduction part lies, **the line is the reduced form of explanation**.

## The Mathematical Functions
The mathematical functions that design the regression line is:  
<center>$ \hat{y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + ... + \beta_{n}X_{n} $</center>  
$ \hat{y} $ is the estimation of response, $ \beta_{0} $ is the intercept, $ \beta_{n} $ is the coefficients of regression and $ X_{n} $ is the explanatory variables. In Machine Learning, we would call response as target, intercept as bias, coefficients as weight (interchangeably) and explanatory variables as features. The best way to understand this equation is by seeing the graphs its represent.

As you can see from the graphs, $ \beta_{0} $ or the bias is responsible to adjust the line height, while the $ \beta_{n} $ or the weights is responsible to adjust the slope of the line. Both of them will try to approximate the input data (features) to get as close as possible to the output data (target).
